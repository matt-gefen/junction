# **Description** 

The challenge of finding community is continuous. During a global pandemic it is an even greater challenge. We felt there is a need for a place to help connect people of various interest groups in a way that builds community. There are other Apps available that easily fill the 'social media' market. We are aware of that, we are also aware of the ever growing problem of selling user information and allowing targeted marketing for profit.

Junction is **NOT** about sharing user information, or allowing marketers to lure users with bait click offers. No our vision and goal is to build community and bring people together in a positiv, enriching way. With the user and their interest in mind. It is a place to find groups based around common interests and share interesting events, resources, and ideas.

In order to keep the focus on each users individual value and to help protect emotional wellness we intentially will not add a 'Like' button.
